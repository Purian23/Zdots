## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

### Project overview

Zdots is a modular Zsh dotfiles/shell-configuration project. There is no build system, no package manager lockfile, and no test framework. The "application" is `setup.sh`, a Bash script that assembles modular `.zsh` config fragments from `zsh/` into `~/.zshrc`, installs Zinit (plugin manager), and optionally copies `starship.toml`.

### Running setup.sh non-interactively

```bash
ZDOTS_NONINTERACTIVE=1 bash setup.sh
```

This uses prompt defaults and automatically skips `chsh` and the immediate shell-switch (which would hang without a TTY). For full "yes to everything" behavior, use `ZDOTS_YES=1` — but note that `chsh` and shell-switch are still safely skipped when no TTY is detected.

To preview without making changes: `bash setup.sh --dry-run`

### Linting

```bash
shellcheck setup.sh
```

Should produce zero findings (all previous info-level notices have been resolved).

### Testing the generated config

```bash
zsh -c 'source ~/.zshrc; echo "ZSH_VERSION=$ZSH_VERSION"'
```

First run after setup downloads Zinit plugins from GitHub (takes ~15s). Subsequent runs are fast (~57ms).

**Note:** turbo-loaded plugins (`zsh-syntax-highlighting`, `zsh-autosuggestions`) only activate in a real interactive terminal with ZLE. Testing via `zsh -i <<'EOF'` heredoc or `zsh -c` won't trigger them — use the Desktop pane terminal instead.

### Startup benchmark

```bash
zsh -c 'time zsh -i -c exit'
```
